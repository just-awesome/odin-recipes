    <p>
        A dosa, dose, dosai or dosha is a thin, savoury crepe in Indian cuisine
        made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice. Dosas are 
        served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew).
        Dosas are a common food in South India.

        The dosa originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins 
        are unknown. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the
         Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient 
         Tamil country around the 1st century CE.[1] However, according to 
         historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in 
         present-day Karnataka.[2] Achaya states that the earliest written mention 
         of dosa appears in the 8th-century literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, 
         while the earliest mention of dosa in Kannada literature appears a century 
         later.[3]
