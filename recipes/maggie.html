    <p>Julius Maggi experimented for two years with different methods of mechanical
        and chemical processing of legumes and different mixtures. The results were 
        presented to the representatives of the Society on 19 November 1884. They 
        approved the results and signed a contract to exclusively recommend Maggi's 
        legumes for a period of three years. Maggi, in turn, guaranteed a fixed price 
        and regular product controls for sales in Switzerland. However, the Society 
        was accused of representing the interests of a private company. The Maggi 
        company, on the other hand, had difficulties challenging other suppliers 
        of soup powder on the market, despite support from the Society.

        high wages."[18] The transfer of the commercial department from 
        Berlin to Frankfurt in 1949 also triggered great skepticism among the 
        workers' counci
